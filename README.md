SWAT2R is an R package that provides S3 functions for reading the main output files of the Soil & Water Assessment Tool hydrological model (SWAT) and for creating some inputs files to SWAT-CUP. This package as been only used with SWAT-2005. Compatibility problems with SWAT 2009 are welcomed (with a reproducible example).

Reading functions are particularly efficient for large output files (hundreds of Mb).

Bugs / comments / questions / collaboration of any kind are very welcomed.
